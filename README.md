Run the *main.cpp* file in the workspace. A pop-up window should appear.

### Resources

The game is build from scratch based on the following [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/?couponCode=OF83024E).

The game assets and/or sprites were either provided by the course as resources or downloaded from the web - [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets).
